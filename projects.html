		<p>The Stony Brook Assembler and Run-time Simulator (STARS) is a MIPS Assembly simulator. Currently, STARS is a command-line based simulator that is inspired by the MARS simulator and has a command-line debugger that is based on GDB. STARS is made entirely in Python.</p>

		<p>This project was made for NASA's Independent Verification & Validation Facility (IV&V) to aid with monitoring testing simulations in QEMU. The GUI allows users to view memory contents, view the QEMU memory tree structure, view the currentlyexecuting  assembly  instruction,  view  the  CPU  register  contents,  view  QEMU  trace  events,  view  QEMUHMP logs, and track how fast the simulation is executing as compared to real time. Additionally, this GUI is first planned to be used for testing the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and is intended to be used for more missions in the future. The GUI is made in Python and the QEMU QMP additions are made in C.</p>

				<p>This project was made as part of a REU at Auburn University. The goal of the project was to make 3D maps using a 2D LiDAR, IMU, and UAV. For this project, we ended up using a RPLIDAR A1, a 3DR IRIS (which uses a Pixhawk flight controller), and a Rspberry Pi 3B. Our method of mapping was to mount the LiDAR on its side and then have the UAV yaw 360 degrees so it gave a near-complete sphere of view of the surroundings. This project was coded in Python and C++.<br>

				<h2><a href="https://github.com/BTMichalowicz/E-Commerce" target="_blank">E-Commerce Pro</a></h2>
				<p>E-Commerce Pro was the final project for Stony Brook University's CSE 305: Principles of Database Systems. It is a basic Amazon-esque (if you ignore the lack of aesthetics) online store. This project required making a locally hosted database in MySQL and making a simple front end using HTML and embedded JavaScript.</p>

			<p>Xacto Client Service is a final project for Stony Brook University's CSE 320 course. Xacto Client Service is a remote-accessible server that basically functions as a hashmap. Once running, clients can connect to the server and give various "get" amd "put" commands to retrieve and save values into the hashmap. After doing all necessary "get" and "put" commands, the client can then commit their changes to the server. This project was made entirely in C.</p>

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/Hello911/SideBySideFinal" target="_blank">Side By Side</a></h2>
			<p>Side By Side is an Android App made to help track weightloss progress. It achieves this by having users take pictures of themselves daily and tag the photos with various health data. Users can then select photos from different days and both visually and quantitatively see their weightloss progress. This app was made in Java.</p>

			<h2>BME App</h2>
			<p>BME app is an Android App made to work in tandem with a wearable health monitor. The app connected with the wearable, health-monitoring device via Bluetooth Low Energy and then storedthe health data in a database which can be accessed by the userâ€™s doctor. The app is coded in Java.</p>
			<p>This project was presented as a poster at the NEBEC 2018 conference.</p>
