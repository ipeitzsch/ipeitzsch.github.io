      <h3>Bio</h3>
       <p>I am a senior Computer Science and Mathematics student at Stony Brook University. After graduation, I hope to pursue my Ph.D. in Computer Science so I can start a career as an academic researcher. My research interests include operating systems, hardware emulation, resilient computing, programming languages, and UAVs. Additionally, I worked with Dr. Mei Lin Chan in Stony Brook University's BME Department to make 2 Android Apps that were both focused on health tracking. My team and I presented a poster for one of the apps at the NEBEC 2018 conference at Drexel University.</p>
	  <p>Currently, I work with Dr. Kevin McDonnell and Jihu Mun on the Stony Brook Assembler and Run-time Simulator (STARS). STARS is a MIPS Assembly simulator that is inspired by the MARS simulator.</p>
	  <p>In the past I have worked with the Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and NASA to aid with making testing simulation software for NASA's Independent Verification & Validation Facility in Fairmont, WV. Additionally, I have done research at Auburn University's REU Site on Smart UAVs where I helped develop and test a new method of making 3D scans of environments using UAVs and LiDAR.</p>
		<p>Besides education and research, I also fence competitively, where I have my C19 in epee.</p>
