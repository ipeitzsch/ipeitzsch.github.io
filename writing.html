		<p>Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a machine-learning method that seeks to mimic the high-dimensional nature of data processing in the cerebellum. To achieve this goal, HDC represents data as large vectors, called hypervectors, and uses a set of well-defined operations to perform symbolic computations on these hypervectors. Using this paradigm, it is possible to create HDC models for classification tasks. These HDC models work by first transforming the input data into hypervectors, and then combining hypervectors of the same class to create a hypervector for representing that task. These HDC models can classify information by transforming new input data into hypervectors, comparing the similarity between data hypervector with each class hypervector, then classifying it based on which class has the highest similarity. Over the past few years, HDC models have greatly improved in accuracy and now compete with more common classification techniques for machine learning, such as neural networks. Additionally, manipulating hypervectors involve many repeated basic operations, making them easy to accelerate using different hardware platforms. This research seeks to exploit this ease of acceleration of HDC models and utilize oneAPI libraries with SYCL to create multiple accelerators for HDC learning tasks for CPUs, GPUs, and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The oneAPI tools are used in this research to accelerate single-pass learning, gradient-descent learning using the NeuralHD algorithm, and inference. Each of these tasks is benchmarked on the Intel Xeon Platinum 8256 CPU, Intel UHD 11th generation GPU, and Intel Stratix 10 FPGA. The GPU implementation showcased the fastest training times for single-pass training and NeuralHD training, with 0.89s and 126.55s, respectively. The FPGA implementation exhibited the lowest inference latency, with an average of 0. 28ms.</p>

	<p>The increased prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has proven advantageous for the development
of useful applications for mapping interiors. Due to their small size and unmanned nature,
UAVs have shown themselves to be optimal tools for indoor mapping, as they reduce risk and are highly
mobile. The purpose of this research is to provide an inexpensive way for UAVs to map in any environment.
Related works have created ways of accomplishing this task, using multiple LiDAR sensors
or having red, green, blue, and depth (RGBD) sensors to assist their system with localization. This
paper proposes a mapping method of mounting a 2D scanning LiDAR with a Pixhawk controller and
yawing 360â—¦ to create an accurate, 3D representation of its surroundings in real-time. When stationary,
the methods proposed can generate an accurate model of the surrounding area; however an accurate
model was unattainable when the UAV moved due to localization errors. Further testing with better
localization methods is required for mapping from multiple points.</p>
