	<p>The increased prevalence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has proven advantageous for the development
of useful applications for mapping interiors. Due to their small size and unmanned nature,
UAVs have shown themselves to be optimal tools for indoor mapping, as they reduce risk and are highly
mobile. The purpose of this research is to provide an inexpensive way for UAVs to map in any environment.
Related works have created ways of accomplishing this task, using multiple LiDAR sensors
or having red, green, blue, and depth (RGBD) sensors to assist their system with localization. This
paper proposes a mapping method of mounting a 2D scanning LiDAR with a Pixhawk controller and
yawing 360â—¦ to create an accurate, 3D representation of its surroundings in real-time. When stationary,
the methods proposed can generate an accurate model of the surrounding area; however an accurate
model was unattainable when the UAV moved due to localization errors. Further testing with better
localization methods is required for mapping from multiple points.</p>
